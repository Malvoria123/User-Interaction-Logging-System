# User Interaction Logging System
🚀 This is a personal project I built by myself. This is a user interaction logging system designed to track and store user activities, such as clicks and form submissions that **works on a real website**. The main goal is to show how we can collect useful behavioral data using modern web technologies — in a safe and developer friendly way.

🎦 This is the YouTube video showing that this system really works on a real website:\

💻 The website used as the frontend in this project was built 100% by myself during my college.

🧠 What This Project Does\
![User Interaction Logging Diagram](assets/Diagram_intera_logs.png)\
This system logs user interactions (clicks and form submissions) on a website and stores them in a secure cloud database. For clicks, it collects:
1. Clicked Products
2. Product Names
3. Timestamps (Date)
4. User Agents (Browser, OS, and Device Information)
5. Screen Widths and Heights

For form submissions, it collects:
1. No. 3, 4, and 5 above
2. First Names
3. Last Names
4. Phone Numbers
5. Email Addresses
6. Genders
7. Problem Descriptions

✅ Why is this useful?\
This user interaction tracking is valuable for:
1. UI/UX designers and developers to understand user behavior and interaction.
2. Product managers to improve features based on interaction data.
3. Marketing and analytics to increase site flow and engagement.

🧰 Tech Stack Used
| Part | Tools | Why I chose it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontend**  | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub Pages | Simple, Industry-Standard, and Free |
| **Backend** | Express.js (Node.js), Railway | Lightweight, Powerful, and Easy to Deploy |
| **Database** | Firebase Firestore | Scalable, No Setup, Real-Time, Free Tier |
| **Versioning** | Git & GitHub | Open Source Hosting |
| **Editor** | Visual Studio Code (VSCode) | Feature-rich and Widely Used by Developers |
| **AI Assistant** | ChatGPT, Qwen, Deepseek, etc. | To Help with Faster Writing, Coding, Debugging, and Fixes |

🚀 Why These Tools?\
**Express.js**: It’s a minimal, fast Node.js framework — perfect for building lightweight APIs.

**Railway**: Railway makes it easy to deploy Node.js/Express backends quickly with seamless GitHub integration. Plus, it offers a free tier that’s perfect for small-scale projects.

**Firebase Firestore**: Cloud-hosted, scalable NoSQL database — no need for backend management, easy to use, and free for small projects.

I chose these to focus on practicing data collection, while keeping deployment and setup simple.

🛡️ Security Features\
This project is not just about logging — it’s also safe and secure:
1. **Rate Limiting**: Max 50 requests (May be adjusted) per 15 minutes per IP using express-rate-limit to prevent spam or abuse.
2. **CORS Restriction**: Only accepts requests from https://malvoria123.github.io to prevent cross-site attacks.
3. **API Key Protection**: All requests must include a valid API key in headers for authentication.

🧩 This is how I did this project:\
**> Frontend Setup**
1. Create HTML pages with clickable elements and forms.
2. Add scripts that listens for user clicks and submissions and sends logs to backend.

**> Backend Setup**

1. Use Express.js to create a POST endpoint to accept logs.
2. Secure it with CORS, API key checking, and rate limiter.
3. Use Firebase Admin SDK to send logs into Firestore.

**> Deploy**

1. Push frontend to a GitHub repo and deploy with GitHub Pages.
2. Push backend code to another GitHub repo and deploy it on Railway.
3. Set environment variables like API_KEY, PORT and FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT on Railway.

**> Test**
1. Open frontend, click elements, make form submissions, and check if logs are saved in Firestore.
2. Use browser console or curl to simulate requests and test security limits.

💡 What I Learned
1. How to connect front-end, backend, and database together
2. How to protect APIs using CORS and API Keys
3. How to deploy real-world apps using Railway and GitHub
4. How to use AI to improve productivity and problem solving

📌 Future Improvements
1. Add user session tracking or anonymized IDs
2. Create a dashboard to visualize logs using charts
3. Add support for more event types (scroll, hover, etc.)
