    <div class="title">History of VKellogg's:</div>
    <div class="imgcon"><img src="../assets/others/VKellogg-Past.webp" class="img"></div>
    <div class="exp">VKellogg’s was founded by a renowned chef named Will Keith Kellogg in 1906, Battle Creek, Michigan, United States. Will Keith Kellogg, also known as Kellogg, has been known for his culinary feat, especially in the fields of breakfast and snacks, since 1903. Before he founded this company, he was working as a chef at the world’s renowned 5 michelin star restaurant, Sultan Restaurant. He quited his job and founded VKellogg’s to further express his culinary expertise.<br><br>In 1908, VKellogg’s has attracted over three thousand orders across Michigan itself. At the same year, VKellogg’s opened its first production branch in New York City and four others in Miami, Boston, Los Angeles, and Seattle in 1911-1916. VKellogg’s has been heavily impacted by The Great Depression and almost declared bankruptcy in 1935. But VKellogg’s always strived for food flavor and made customers’ day with our service.<br><br>As a result, VKellogg’s has become multinational company by opening its first international production branch in Toronto, Canada in 1950, Manchester, United Kingdom in 1954, and 20 more in Europe and Asia from 1956 to 1968. Now, VKellogg’s has more than 120 branches across the globe.</div>
